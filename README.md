A USB Video Class (UVC) camera library for Android and a plugin for Flutter.

This project is a hard fork of the original [UVCCamera by saki4510t](https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera) and is
brought to you by [Alexey Pelykh](https://alexey-pelykh.com) with a great gratitude to the original project's
author [saki4510t](https://github.com/saki4510t/) and its community of contributors. It includes some improvements from
the original project's forks and PRs.

## Usage

### Android library

The library is available on Maven Central. To use it in your project, add the following dependency:

either to your `build.gradle` file in the `dependencies` block:

```groovy
implementation 'org.uvccamera:lib:0.1.0'
```

or to your `build.gradle.kts` file in the `dependencies` block:

```kotlin
implementation("org.uvccamera:lib:0.1.0")
```

### Flutter plugin

The Flutter plugin is available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/uvccamera). To use it in your Flutter project, add
the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  uvccamera: ^0.1.0
```

See the [Flutter example](https://pub.dev/packages/uvccamera/example) for an app that uses the plugin.

## Development & Contribution

This section describes how to build the Android library and the Flutter plugin from the source code locally.

See the [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for branch strategy and workflow details.

For detailed architecture and API documentation, see the [docs/](./docs/) folder.

### Building Android library

The Android library is built using Gradle. To build the library, run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew :lib:assembleRelease
```

There are number of test applications available.

### Building Flutter plugin example

A prerequisite for building the Flutter plugin example locally is to have the Android library built and published to the
machine's local Maven repository. To publish the library to the local Maven repository, run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew :lib:publishToMavenLocal
```

After that, you can build the Flutter plugin example by running the following command:

```shell
cd flutter/example
flutter build apk
```
